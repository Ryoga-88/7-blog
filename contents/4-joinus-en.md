Our laboratory is tackling the challenge of soft computing, which aims to equip computers with the "flexibility to tolerate ambiguity"â€”a quality inherent in humans and other living beings. Rather than focusing solely on "speed" and "accuracy," which have traditionally been the goals of computer science, we are working to develop intelligent systems capable of flexible, human-like decision-making. In the era of big data, we strive to implement human-like qualities in artificial intelligence that go beyond conventional hard computing, which prioritizes precision, with the goal of realizing a richer and more compassionate information society.

Through our research activities, we also aim to enhance our programming and English communication skills. In particular, our graduate students frequently present at international conferences, and we are dedicated to nurturing talent capable of thriving on the global stage.

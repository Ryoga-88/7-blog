This project is a collaboration between Osaka Metropolitan University & Kyushu University in Japan and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence GmbH (DFKI) in Germany. The project is funded by the Adopting Sustainable Partnerships for Innovative Research Ecosystem (ASPIRE) program led by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

This project aims to achieve the following two goals. (1) Multi-layered R&D Network Development: We aim to establish an X-Type global human resource development that exchange researchers and students between Japan and Germany. (2) Industry Creation: We support creating start-ups and providing opportunities for students to implement their ideas in the real world.

  - title: "Word-of-Mouth Travel Navigator"
    description: "This system applies collaborative filtering to estimate ratings for unrated travel destinations based on similarities in user preferences, creating a mechanism to explore personalized recommendations. It replicates the 'word of mouth' effect ('Let me tell you about places highly rated by people with similar tastes to yours') on a computer, exploring theories and techniques for estimating missing values from a matrix of ratings provided by numerous users."

  - title: "Data Mining with a Focus on Ambiguity"
    description: "This research utilizes soft computing methods based on fuzzy theory and rough set theory to tackle data mining and knowledge discovery that reflect human ambiguity. In the era of big data, as the need for clustering technology to automatically classify vast amounts of data increases, we aim to achieve more flexible and reliable classification methods by considering the ambiguity and uncertainty in classification."

  - title: "Learning Algorithms Inspired by Human Cognition"
    description: "Recent learning algorithms have evolved by refining human learning frameworks from an information science perspective. This research explores the realization of efficient learning processes by incorporating improvements to conventional methods through a cognitive approach. By focusing on how elements modeled after neurons navigate an S-shaped maze, we aim to construct more effective learning methods by skillfully utilizing ambiguity."
